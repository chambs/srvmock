srvmock
=======

A simple server mock

It is intended to be used when you don't have a backend communication, so that you can mock all servers responses in order to test the frontend work, validations, callback functions and so on.

**The API can be found at the lib folder**

###How to use it

You must first define schemas, like this:

```javascript
	var mySchema = {
		name: 'users',
		fields: [
			{name: 'id', type: 'number', size: 20},
			{name: 'name', type: 'string', size: 20}
		]
	};
```

And then you must register this schema in order to srvmock generate content for you:

```javascript
	srvmock.setSchema(mySchema);
```

Finally, you can ask srvmock to return a list of data based on that schema:


```javascript
	/*
	This will give you an array with 12 dinamically generated users
	based on mySchema.

	*/
	var userList = srvmock.httpGet('users', 12);
```


If you don't pass the second argument, srvmock will only retrieve data from localStorage

How to persist data on localStorage, you ask:

```javascript
	//this will persist the object containing id = 111 and name = Willian
	//it will also return the id generated by zon API
	srvmock.httpPost('users', {id:111, name: 'Willian'});
```
